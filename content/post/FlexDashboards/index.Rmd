# Overview
- This is a working document to provide a roadmap to create a FlexDashboard for Clinical Research  
- Of note, the data here is completly fabricated, any relation to real subjects is completely coincidental
- The purpose of a FlexDashboard is to present your data in way that enhances data intrepretation or to provide patients with comprehendable information depending on how you use the data
- There are many excellent tutorials on using the package `Flexdashboard` to create a dashboard; however, we still hit many roadblocks that we hope you can avoid if you follow our instructions and code  
- What we will show you next is the code we used to create the following Flesdashboard

# Load Packages
```{r load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
library(RCurl)
library(REDCapR)
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
library(scales)
```

# Format of Flexdashboard
- The Flexdashboard package is build around RMarkdown  
- To start, you can open a new RMarkdown by
  - File -> New File -> RMarkdown
  - Then go to "From Template" on the left hand column
  - If you have installed `Flexdashboard` then Flexdashboard will be in the window that opens  
  - Once you have selected Flexdashboard a new RMarkdown will open
  - What is specific here is the YAML 
    - The content between the three dashes in beginning of the RMarkdown

- This is the YAML for the Flexdashboard


title: "Untitled"  
output:  
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:  
    orientation: columns  
    vertical_layout: fill


- Then after the YAML, the Flexdashboard template is quite basic  
- You will generate code for the the three charts that you want displayed
- The template calls them Chart A, Chart B, Chart C. 
- Each Chart is preceded by three `#`s and is flanked by a long series of dashes  
- You can then change the title from `Chart A` to the title you desire  
- Then following the Title, you have a "r chunk" that you use to generate your charts


# Load Your Dataset
- This is a fabricated dataset in Excel, but has many features that resemble an actual rare disease cohort dataset
```{r Load the data}
dt <- read_excel("mcc_cohort_fake.xlsx")
```

# View Dataset
```{r view entire dataset}
dt %>% kable
```

# Age at Diagnosis Chart

## Wrangle Data for Age at Diagnosis
```{r data wrangle age at dx}
Age_at_Dx <- dt %>% select(record_id, age_at_dx) %>% drop_na(age_at_dx) # drop_na is a good function to eliminate rows that have missing values
Age_at_Dx$subjects <- "subjects" # add a column that unifies all the data (helpful for plotly)
```
# View Dataset Age at Dx
```{r view wranglded data table}
Age_at_Dx %>% kable
```

# Graph your Data 

## Plotly Graph of Age at Diagnosis
```{r Plotly Age at Diagnosis}
plot_ly(data = Age_at_Dx, type = "box") %>% 
  add_boxplot(x = Age_at_Dx$subjects, y = Age_at_Dx$age_at_dx, 
              boxpoints = "all", jitter = 0.3, pointpos = -1.8,
              marker = list(color = 'rgb(7,40,89)'),
              line = list(color = 'rgb(7,40,89)'),
              color = I("steelblue4"),
              name = "MGH-HCC Cohort") %>% 
  layout(title = "Age at Diagnosis of MCC")
```

# Bar Chart of Stage of Diagnosis 
```{r}
cStage <-dt %>% select(record_id, man_clinstage, man_pathstage) %>% drop_na(man_clinstage) %>% filter(man_clinstage < 98)
cStageDF <- cStage %>% group_by(man_clinstage) %>% tally()
plot_ly(data = cStageDF) %>% 
  add_bars(x = cStageDF$man_clinstage, y = cStageDF$n,
           color = I("steelblue4")) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Clinical Stage at Presentation",
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Subjects"),
    xaxis = list(title = "Clincal Stage", ticktext = list("I", "IIA", "IIB", "III", "IV"), tickvals = list(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)))
```

# BarChart of Pathological Staging at Diagnosis
```{r}
pStage <-dt %>% select(record_id, man_clinstage, man_pathstage) %>% drop_na(man_pathstage) %>% filter(man_pathstage < 6)
pStageDF <- pStage %>% group_by(man_pathstage) %>% tally()
plot_ly(data = pStageDF) %>% 
  add_bars(x = pStageDF$man_pathstage, y = pStageDF$n,
           color = I("steelblue4")) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Pathological Stage at Presentation",
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Subjects"),
    xaxis = list(title = "Pathological Stage", ticktext = list("I", "IIA", "IIB", "IIIA", "IIIB","IV"), tickvals = list(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))
```

### Recapitulate the RMarkdown with the Flexdashboard Template
- What we have above is a step by step of what the data looks like to generate the Flexddashboard and essentially all of the code used to generate the figures  
- What we have below is a more direct representation of where you would put that code to generate the following Flexdashboard
![png](/img/MCC_fake_flexdashbboard.png)
- You will see essentially 3 r chunks and all of the code used placed into those three; including the code to load the data, that can go in the first code chunk under the ### Chart A section


`Column {data-width=650}`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart A - Age at Diagnosis

```{r Chart A, eval=FALSE}
dt <- read_excel("mcc_cohort_fake.xlsx") # Load the data
Age_at_Dx <- dt %>% select(record_id, age_at_dx) %>% drop_na(age_at_dx) # drop_na is a good function to eliminate rows that have missing values
Age_at_Dx$subjects <- "subjects" # add a column that unifies all the data (helpful for plotly)
Age_at_Dx %>% kable
plot_ly(data = Age_at_Dx, type = "box") %>% 
  add_boxplot(x = Age_at_Dx$subjects, y = Age_at_Dx$age_at_dx, 
              boxpoints = "all", jitter = 0.3, pointpos = -1.8,
              marker = list(color = 'rgb(7,40,89)'),
              line = list(color = 'rgb(7,40,89)'),
              color = I("steelblue4"),
              name = "MGH-HCC Cohort") %>% 
  layout(title = "Age at Diagnosis of MCC")
```

`Column {data-width=350}`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart B - Clinical Stage at Diagnosis

```{r Chart B - clincal stage at Diagnosis, eval=FALSE}
cStage <-dt %>% select(record_id, man_clinstage, man_pathstage) %>% drop_na(man_clinstage) %>% filter(man_clinstage < 98)
cStageDF <- cStage %>% group_by(man_clinstage) %>% tally()
plot_ly(data = cStageDF) %>% 
  add_bars(x = cStageDF$man_clinstage, y = cStageDF$n,
           color = I("steelblue4")) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Clinical Stage at Presentation",
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Subjects"),
    xaxis = list(title = "Clincal Stage", ticktext = list("I", "IIA", "IIB", "III", "IV"), tickvals = list(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)))
```

### Chart C - Pathological Stage at Diagnosis

```{r Chart C, eval=FALSE}
pStage <-dt %>% select(record_id, man_clinstage, man_pathstage) %>% drop_na(man_pathstage) %>% filter(man_pathstage < 6)
pStageDF <- pStage %>% group_by(man_pathstage) %>% tally()
plot_ly(data = pStageDF) %>% 
  add_bars(x = pStageDF$man_pathstage, y = pStageDF$n,
           color = I("steelblue4")) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Pathological Stage at Presentation",
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Subjects"),
    xaxis = list(title = "Pathological Stage", ticktext = list("I", "IIA", "IIB", "IIIA", "IIIB","IV"), tickvals = list(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))
```

**This is what that RMarkdown looks like with the FlexDashbaord Template**
![png](/img/MCC_fake_dash_template.png)

### If you have many charts that you would like to include on your dashboard, you may want to divide the dashboard into multiple pages. Each page is defined by a level 1 markdown header, (=========), and will have an individual navigation tab.
- For example, in the data shown above, we may want to have age of diagnosis of MCC on a page by itself, and the clinical and pathological staging on a second page in the dashboard. 

PAGE 1: Age at Diagnosis of MCC
======================================================================
### Chart A - Age at Diagnosis of MCC

```{r Chart A age at diagnosis of mcc , eval=FALSE}
dt <- read_excel("mcc_cohort_fake.xlsx") # Load the data
Age_at_Dx <- dt %>% select(record_id, age_at_dx) %>% drop_na(age_at_dx) # drop_na is a good function to eliminate rows that have missing values
Age_at_Dx$subjects <- "subjects" # add a column that unifies all the data (helpful for plotly)
Age_at_Dx %>% kable
plot_ly(data = Age_at_Dx, type = "box") %>% 
  add_boxplot(x = Age_at_Dx$subjects, y = Age_at_Dx$age_at_dx, 
              boxpoints = "all", jitter = 0.3, pointpos = -1.8,
              marker = list(color = 'rgb(7,40,89)'),
              line = list(color = 'rgb(7,40,89)'),
              color = I("steelblue4"),
              name = "MGH-HCC Cohort") %>%

plot_ly(data = cStageDF) %>%
