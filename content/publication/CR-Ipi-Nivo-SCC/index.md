# Abstract:

Although most cases of metastatic cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma mCSCC can be cured with local therapy, up to 8,000 deaths occur each year. With no US Food and Drug Administration-approved options available for mcSCC, common approaches include platinum- based chemotherapy and off-label cetuximab. These strategies lack durability, and overall survival for mcSCC is only 10.9 months. Here we report a complete pathologic response after 4 cycles of nivolumab and the antieCTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, in a patient with mCSCC.
