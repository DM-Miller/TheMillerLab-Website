      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;: Immune-directed therapies have become front-line therapy for melanoma and are transforming the management of advanced disease. In refractory cases, multi-modal immunoncology (IO) approaches are being utilized, including combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with oncolytic herpes viruses. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is the first genetically modified oncolytic viral therapy (OVT) approved for the treatment of recurrent and unresectable melanoma. The use of IO in patients with concomitant malignancies and/or compromised immune systems is limited due to systematic exclusion from clinical trials. For example, a single case report of a solid organ transplant patient successfully treated with T-VEC for metastatic melanoma has been reported. Furthermore, the use of ICB in T-cell malignancies is limited and paradoxical worsening has been described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dual ICB/T-VEC being administered to a patient with concurrent primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and melanoma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CASE PRESENTATION&lt;/strong&gt;: Here we present the case of a patient with concomitant primary cutaneous ALCL and metastatic melanoma, progressing on anti-programmed death (PD)-1 therapy, who developed Kaposi&#39;s varicelliform eruption after receiving the first dose of Talimogene laherparepvec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;: This case highlights the complexities of care of patients with coexistent cancers, demonstrates rapid progression of primary cutaneous ALCL on nivolumab and introduces a novel adverse effect of Talimogene laherparepvec.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Complete Response in cSCC with Ipi/Nivo</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most cases of metastatic cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma mCSCC can be cured with local therapy, up to 8,000 deaths occur each year. With no US Food and Drug Administration-approved options available for mcSCC, common approaches include platinum- based chemotherapy and off-label cetuximab. These strategies lack durability, and overall survival for mcSCC is only 10.9 months. Here we report a complete pathologic response after 4 cycles of nivolumab and the antieCTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, in a patient with mCSCC.&lt;/p&gt;
