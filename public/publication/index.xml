      <title>Generalized Acquired Cutis Laxa Associated with Monoclonal Gammopathy of Dermatological Significance</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutis laxa is a rare dermatosis that is inherited or acquired and clinically features loose, wrinkled, and redundant skin with decreased elasticity. This heterogeneous connective tissue disorder may be localized or generalized, with or without internal manifestations. Generalized cutis laxa often has a cephalocaudal progression and is attributed to inflammatory cutaneous eruptions, medications, and infections. Cutis laxa is also associated with several other conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and plasma-cell dyscrasias. Case Presentation. We report an unusual case of a 35-year-old male with progression of generalized acquired cutis laxa and vasculitis that occurred over a period of one year. No cutaneous inflammatory eruption preceded or accompanied his decreased skin elasticity, and a biopsy of the skin showed elastolysis. His cutaneous manifestation led to systemic evaluation and an eventual diagnosis of smoldering multiple myeloma accompanied by aortitis and anemia. His myeloma and vasculitis were successfully treated with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and high-dose prednisone, respectively, with no improvement to his cutis laxa. Conclusions. The presence of monoclonal gammopathy is strongly associated with several dermatological entities such as acquired cutis laxa. We propose a new term for the dermatological manifestations caused by paraproteinemia: monoclonal gammopathy of dermatological significance, or MGODS, and stress the evaluation of an underlying gammopathy in the setting of certain dermatologic conditions, including scleromyxedema and amyloidosis. We present a case of a newly acquired cutis laxa secondary to plasma-cell dyscrasias that exemplifies MGODS, alongside a brief literature review, and underscore the clinical relevance of monoclonal gammopathies of dermatological significance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inhibition of Haspin kinase promotes cell-intrinsic and extrinsic anti-tumor activity</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanoma patients resistant to RAF/MEK-inhibitors (RMi) are frequently resistant to other therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and individuals succumb to their disease. New drugs that control tumor growth and favorably modulate the immune environment are therefore needed. We report that the small molecule CX-6258 has potent activity against both RMi sensitive (RMS) and resistant (RMR) melanoma cell lines. Haspin Kinase (HASPIN) was identified as a target of CX-6258. HASPIN inhibition resulted in reduced proliferation, frequent formation of micronuclei (MN), recruitment of cGAS and activation of the cGAS-STING-pathway. In murine models, CX-6258 induced a potent cGAS-dependent type-I-interferon response in tumor cells, increased IFNÎ³-producing CD8+ T-cells and reduced Treg frequency in vivo. HASPIN was more strongly expressed in malignant compared to healthy tissue and its inhibition by CX-6258 had minimal toxicity in ex vivo expanded human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), proliferating TILs and in vitro differentiated neurons, suggesting a potential therapeutic index for anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, the activity of CX-6258 was validated in several Ewing sarcoma and multiple myeloma cell lines. Thus, HASPIN inhibition may overcome drug resistance in melanoma, modulate the immune environment and target a vulnerability in different cancer lineages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clinical spectrum of cutaneous melanoma morphology.</title>
      <link>/publication/clinical-spectrum-of-melanoma/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/publication/clinical-spectrum-of-melanoma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;: Melanoma can mimic other cutaneous lesions, but the full spectrum and prevalence of these morphologic variants remain largely unknown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;: To classify nonacral cutaneous melanomas into distinct morphologic clusters and characterize clusters&amp;rsquo; clinicopathologic features.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;METHODS&lt;/strong&gt;: All pathologic melanoma diagnoses (occurring during 2011-2016) were reviewed for routine prebiopsy digital photographs (n = 400). Six dermatologists independently assigned lesions into 1 of 14 diagnostic classes on the basis of morphology. Image consensus clusters were generated by K-means; clinicopathologic features were compared with analysis of variance and chi(2).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RESULTS&lt;/strong&gt;: Five morphologic clusters were identified: typical (n = 136), nevus-like (n = 81), amelanotic/nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC)-like (n = 70), seborrheic keratosis (SK)-like (n = 68), and lentigo/lentigo maligna (LM)-like (n = 45) melanomas. Nevus-like melanomas were found in younger patients. Nevus-like and lentigo/LM-like melanomas tended to be thinner and more likely identified on routine dermatologic examinations. NMSC-like melanomas were tender, thicker, more mitotically active, and associated with prior NMSC. Typical and SK-like melanomas had similar clinicopathologic features. LIMITATIONS: Cluster subdivision yielded diminished sample sizes. Visual assignment was performed without clinical context.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;: When primary cutaneous melanomas were assigned into diagnostic groups and subjected to novel consensus clustering, recurrent morphologic patterns emerged. The spectrum of these morphologies was unexpectedly diverse, which might have implications for visual training and possibly clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;: Immune-directed therapies have become front-line therapy for melanoma and are transforming the management of advanced disease. In refractory cases, multi-modal immunoncology (IO) approaches are being utilized, including combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with oncolytic herpes viruses. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is the first genetically modified oncolytic viral therapy (OVT) approved for the treatment of recurrent and unresectable melanoma. The use of IO in patients with concomitant malignancies and/or compromised immune systems is limited due to systematic exclusion from clinical trials. For example, a single case report of a solid organ transplant patient successfully treated with T-VEC for metastatic melanoma has been reported. Furthermore, the use of ICB in T-cell malignancies is limited and paradoxical worsening has been described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dual ICB/T-VEC being administered to a patient with concurrent primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and melanoma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CASE PRESENTATION&lt;/strong&gt;: Here we present the case of a patient with concomitant primary cutaneous ALCL and metastatic melanoma, progressing on anti-programmed death (PD)-1 therapy, who developed Kaposi&#39;s varicelliform eruption after receiving the first dose of Talimogene laherparepvec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;: This case highlights the complexities of care of patients with coexistent cancers, demonstrates rapid progression of primary cutaneous ALCL on nivolumab and introduces a novel adverse effect of Talimogene laherparepvec.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of CDK7 in Melanoma</title>
      <link>/publication/cdk7/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/publication/cdk7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive tumor that accounts for most skin cancer deaths. Among the physiological barriers against therapeutic success is a strong survival program driven by genes such as MITF that specify melanocyte identity, a phenomenon known in melanoma biology as lineage dependency. MITF overexpression is occasionally explained by gene amplification, but here we show that super-enhancers are also important determinants of MITF overexpression in some melanoma cell lines and tumors. Although compounds that directly inhibit MITF are unavailable, a covalent *&lt;em&gt;CDK7 inhibitor&lt;/em&gt;, THZ1, has recently been shown to potently suppress the growth of various cancers through the depletion of master transcription-regulating oncogenes and the disruption of their attendant super-enhancers. We also show that melanoma cells are highly sensitive to CDK7 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo and that THZ1 can dismantle the super-enhancer apparatus at MITF and SOX10 in some cell lines, thereby extinguishing their intracellular levels. Our results show a dimension to MITF regulation in melanoma cells and point to CDK7 inhibition as a potential strategy to deprive oncogenic transcription and suppress tumor growth in melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most cases of metastatic cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma mCSCC can be cured with local therapy, up to 8,000 deaths occur each year. With no US Food and Drug Administration-approved options available for mcSCC, common approaches include platinum- based chemotherapy and off-label cetuximab. These strategies lack durability, and overall survival for mcSCC is only 10.9 months. Here we report a complete pathologic response after 4 cycles of nivolumab and the antieCTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, in a patient with mCSCC.&lt;/p&gt;
